I usually find myself looking for similarities between architecture and web design. And today it happened again. I am reading _Responsive Design Workflow_ by Stephen Hay, which I bought after seeing one of his latest talks [The Zero Interface: Use Zero-based Thinking to Maintain Simplicity](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/future-of-web-design-london-2014/the-zero-interface-use-zerobased-thinking-to-maintain-simplicity) at the [Future of Web Design - London 2014](https://futureofwebdesign.com/london-2014/).

In the introduction of the book, Stephen describes the way in which they designed things back in 1992:

1. Create thumbnail sketches, then make a selection.
2. From that selection, make some rough sketches.
3. From the best of those choose between one and three (usually it was three...) and work that out in the best visualization possible.

Does it sound familiar to the architects in the room? For me it was like he was talking about how we designed buildings in architecture. But the thing goes further...

4. We started incorporating color-printed images into our design impressions instead of drawing them.
5. ... until I started tdoing all of it in Protoshop because it all looked so _real_.

However he didn't notice that while working with the computer it was taking him longer and longer to do what he used to do by hand. Was it really necessary to visualize in so much detail in the presale phase?

This tendency to want to make pretty pictures of websites started causing problems!

When designing web applications, we need to think not only about form and content, but also about interaction. I did this the whole time while working as an architect (how architecture can influence the behavior of people, how web design can influence the behavior of people). -- Reference BEHAVIOROLOGY
