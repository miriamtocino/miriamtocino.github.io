![Symfony Live Berlin](http://miriamtocino.github.io/images/posts/symfony-live-berlin.png)

This week I will be visiting my first official conference [Symfony Live in Berlin](http://berlin2014.live.symfony.com/) and I feel very excited about it! On Wednesday 29th I will be having a very busy day during the workshop [Web Services with Symfony2](http://berlin2014.live.symfony.com/workshops/). I am looking forward to it, since you know I have been writing about the topic before.
