At the moment I spend most of my time taking care of my 6 months little one. I have some support during the evenings when Daddy gets home and a couple of mornings during the week, so I can have a bit of me-time. Some weeks ago I started a project to fill my days and that I am passionate about: writing stories for kids about Computer Science.

# Why Read to Our Baby?

We have been reading to our little one before going to bed almost since he was born. Last August we visited a book fair where we met a librarian who was so excited about the idea of reading to babies that we needed to try it. She mentioned that it’s supposed to be easier to get them into the magic of reading when they still can’t crawl because once they do, they’d rather explore the world around them by crawling than with books.

Reading to our baby has become one of the favourite moments of the day for us (Mommy and Daddy) and also for him. It is amazing to see how much attention he pays at the book and how he gets cranky if you take it away from him.

Reading to him is a wonderful shared activity that we would like to continue for years to come. Furthermore it is also an important form of stimulation that teaches babies about communication, builds listening and vocabulary and gives information about the world around them.

# What Read to Our Baby?

My parents kept the most wonderful books from my childhood. Daddy reads to him in Spanish. I read to him in English and I am taking books from the library around the corner. He already has his own library membership!

In most of these books there is no reference to new technologies and it doesn’t appear any type of device (computers, phones or tablets). They are usually about animals. And at the same time, I can see his interest in technology increases everyday. We keep screens away from him because it could harm his vision development. But if by any chance he is next to one, the screen gathers his full attention.

It is great that he reads about animals and their different sounds. But he lives in a world where most probably he will first interact with a computer than a sheep. And I would like to give him information about both while I am reading to him. The story of Zerus & Ona appeared just like that.

# How to Follow Zerus & Ona

For the next months I will be working on a series of stories about binary numbers by the hand of Zerus & Ona. I will be sharing the process in different channels:
