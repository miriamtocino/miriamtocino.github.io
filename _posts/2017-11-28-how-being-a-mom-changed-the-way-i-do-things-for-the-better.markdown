There are a lot of things that I didn’t expect from motherhood. Today I want to write about one of them: **how it changed the way I do things (for the better)**.

I have always been interested in productivity and time management. Over the last years I tried lots of tools and different systems: the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) was of great help the two times that I stayed home learning to code and studying German; during my time at [Springest](https://www.springest.nl/) I learned tons about [Holacracy](https://www.holacracy.org/) and [GTD](http://gettingthingsdone.com/); and I followed [The Artist’s Way](http://juliacameronlive.com/books-by-julia/the-artists-way-a-spiritual-path-to-higher-creativity/) during my first weeks teaching at [Codaisseur](http://codaisseur.com/) These are some of my favorites and then it’s [Bullet Journaling](http://bulletjournal.com/), which was a constant since I can remember.

These days I am still using Bullet Journaling as my main source because it just gives me a lot of flexibility. However I cannot commit to morning pages (from The Artist’s Way) or doing things if it takes less than two minutes (from GTD), so most of the others tools that I loved in the past aren’t really an option while taking care of my little one. Motherhood brought me two new things that I needed to deal with for the first time:

1. Having more time to think than to produce
2. Ignoring what I would be doing when

Some weeks ago I started to use the little time I had to do things that I always wanted to do but never found the time for. **Like drawing**. So I started to draw while our little one was sleeping. The moment he closed his eyes, I would take notebook and pen, drawing whatever first came to my mind. **Soon those drawings turned into stories, that I would write in my head when he was eating or we were playing. Stories that I will be reading to him.**

In relation to that I liked [a story that Alex Mathers published last week](https://medium.com/@iamalexmathers/why-speed-is-the-skill-im-most-dedicated-to-improving-2ed6f4af770a) about why speed is the skill he’s most dedicated to improving. Motherhood is teaching me to do exactly that: how to do things faster. Funny thing is that I don’t doubt as much as I used to when I am working on something. Not knowing when he will be waking up or when the next nap will be, inspires me to constantly move forward. It also helps me setting up clear next actions, just because I have enough time to think about what’s the best thing I can do during his next nap.

> I never thought that baby naps would be more effective at boosting my creativity than any Pomodoro timer.

I have drawn in the last weeks more than I could ever imagined. And I am already writing the second of the stories. **They all have one thing in common: computers**. I want to read him stories about what happens behind a screen so he can better understand the world around him. [I wrote more about the ideas behind it some weeks ago](https://medium.com/@miriamtocino/why-writing-stories-for-kids-about-computer-science-c34d51b25ebc).
