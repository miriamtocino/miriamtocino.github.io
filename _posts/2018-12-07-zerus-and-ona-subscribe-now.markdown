At this moment I spend most of my free time writing and illustrating stories for kids (and their grown-ups) about computers, technology and programming. The first of the stories will be out in 2019 and this is the best way to get notified when the book is out. Subscribe now [here](http://www.zerusandona.com/) and follow the process in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/miriamtocino) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/miriamtocino).

I hope to see you there!
