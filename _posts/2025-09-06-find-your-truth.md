Every day we are told stories. Some of them are inspiring, while others might be conflicting.


The practice isn’t to silence the noise or wait for the perfect version. Instead, it’s to build the skill to sort, to question, to see beyond the angle someone else wants to impose.


Truth is rarely handed down fully formed. It emerges when curiosity meets clarity, when we give space for questions, and when we model calm and honesty instead of control and fear.


We thrive when we feel safe to form our own perspective. And strong enough to stand by it.


The greatest strength is not in repeating someone else’s truth, but in finding the courage to define your own.
