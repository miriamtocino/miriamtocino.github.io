We often hear that time is the most precious resource. But in practice, it’s not. The real bottleneck is energy.

Looking only at hours on the clock misses the real signal: friction. Friction is what drains energy before a task even begins. It’s the weight that makes something feel harder than it should. 

That’s where energy leaks.

A task that takes thirty minutes can feel like it costs an entire day if the friction is high enough. Another task, longer on paper, can feel light and even give energy back if the flow is right. The math isn’t about time anymore. 

The new currency isn’t time. It’s energy.
