AI transformation is often framed as a mountain to climb. A huge shift that only a few will be able to lead. But that framing creates distance before we even begin.

Transformation happens when knowledge moves freely, not just when new tools are added. Adoption takes root when learning is part of the daily flow of work.

Organizations need shared spaces.

Spaces where people feel safe to ask questions, to try things out, to not know the answer yet. Places where knowledge doesn’t sit with one expert or one team, but flows through the environment itself.

Knowledge no longer belongs to the teacher. It doesn’t belong to the student either. Knowledge belongs to the environment.

And in environments where knowledge flows, adoption becomes part of the way we work.
