It’s easy to forget how new the internet really is.

We act as if it’s always been here, but in truth we’re still early explorers. Like primitives in a digital world we’re only beginning to understand.

That reminder matters.

It keeps us humble, and it makes us responsible.

Because with every click, every post or comment, and every habit, we’re daily shaping the culture that future generations will inherit.

May we mind the primitive we are online.
