An eagle builds her nest with sharp branches. Then she covers them with feathers so her chicks feel safe.

As they grow, she removes the soft layer. The thorns press through. The center is no longer comfortable, so the young move to the edge. From there, they see the sky. One day, they fly.

This is parenting. And it’s leadership too.

We start with comfort and clarity. Slowly, we guide toward the edge.

If the nest is strong, they don’t leap alone. They return with questions. They know the difference between freedom and being left on their own.

First, we build the nest. Then we trust the flight.
