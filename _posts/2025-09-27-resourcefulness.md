Resilience helps us survive. Resourcefulness helps us thrive.

When we feel resourceful, we move forward. Not by reading another manual. Not by waiting for perfect instructions.

We grow our resourcefulness by stepping into the mystery.

When we try before we feel ready.
When we ask the question that seems too obvious.
When we get it wrong, and learn as we go.

Resourcefulness is also highly contagious. When one of us starts finding a way through, others believe they can too. And then momentum builds.

May we stop protecting ourselves from uncertainty and start treating it as practice.
