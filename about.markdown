# About

This is one long page where I can write about myself without trying to be useful.

Some day, this site may be all that’s left of me.  
So I might as well write my own small autobiography.

*Last updated: 2025-12-21*

## A timeline, for context

I’ve learned that context matters more than conclusions.

**1985** — born in Spain  
**2003–2008** — studied architecture; learned how structure holds space  
**2009–2013** — moved into software and digital systems  
**2014–2017** — worked in education and learning projects  
**2018–2020** — began operating teams and companies more formally  
**2021–present** — chief operating officer, writer, and builder of people-centered systems  

Along the way:  
moving cities, becoming a mother, learning to translate between worlds that don’t always speak to each other.

## What I keep coming back to

I’ve always been drawn to how things work beneath the surface.

Not just products or organizations, but people.  
How meaning forms.  
How confusion spreads.  
How clarity changes behavior.

I’m less interested in speed than in coherence.  
Less interested in scale than in alignment.

Over time, I’ve found myself naturally in roles where I sit between:
- technology and people  
- strategy and execution  
- intention and reality  

I don’t enjoy being at the center.  
I enjoy helping the center hold.

## Work, for me

I use the word *work* because it’s convenient, but what I really mean is attention.

I like long stretches of focused thinking.  
I like turning something complex into something simple enough to hold.  
I like when teams stop reacting and start moving deliberately.

My best days are quiet ones:  
writing, structuring, asking questions, listening carefully.

I’m comfortable operating behind the scenes.  
Trust matters more to me than visibility.

## On ambition and direction

I’ve never been motivated by status or titles.

What moves me is direction:  
the feeling that something meaningful is taking shape,  
that people understand each other a little better,  
that a system becomes easier to live inside.

At different moments, this has shown up as:
- building organizations  
- writing for parents and children  
- creating learning frameworks  
- helping leadership teams think more clearly  

The form changes.  
The impulse stays the same.

## Technology, gently held

I don’t see technology as progress or threat.

I see it as amplification.

It amplifies whatever is already there:  
clarity or confusion,  
care or neglect,  
intention or noise.

That’s why I’m interested in how we introduce technology —  
especially to children, teams, and cultures that didn’t design it.

Not to fear it.  
Not to glorify it.  
But to understand it.

## A few personal truths (for now)

I value depth over breadth.  
I prefer conversations to broadcasting.  
I think slowly, and I trust that pace.

I’m a mother. That has changed everything.  
It has made time feel precious and honesty non-negotiable.

I don’t believe there is one right way to live or work.  
I do believe in paying attention to what is actually happening.

## Where I am now

I live in Spain.

I work with people and teams across borders, disciplines, and contexts.

I write to think.  
I build systems to support people.  
I try to leave places clearer than I found them.

## If you’re still reading

This page isn’t meant to convince you of anything.

It’s just here so you know who is speaking when you read the rest of the site.

If something here resonates, you’re welcome to stay.  
If not, that’s fine too.
