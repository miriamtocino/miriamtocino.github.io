# About Me

This is my little corner of the internet, a place for me to write about myself without any pressure to be useful. I figure if this site is still around years from now, it might be nice to have my story here. A sort of mini-autobiography.

*Last updated: 2025-12-21*

## A Little Bit of Context

I believe that to understand someone, it helps to know where they come from. Here’s a quick timeline of my journey so far.

- **1984**: Born in Spain
- **2003–2008**: Studied architecture, where I learned how structure creates space.
- **2009–2013**: Shifted my focus to software and digital systems.
- **2014–2017**: Worked on projects in education and learning.
- **2018–2020**: Started taking on more formal roles in managing teams and companies.
- **2021–present**: Currently working as a chief operating officer, writer, and builder of systems that put people first.

And in between all of that, there was life: moving to new cities, becoming a mother, and learning how to connect different worlds that don't always speak the same language.

## What I'm Drawn To

I've always been curious about what makes things tick. Not just on the surface, with products or companies, but on a deeper level with people. I'm fascinated by how we find meaning, why confusion happens, and how a little bit of clarity can make a big difference.

I care more about making sure things make sense together than just moving fast. I'm more interested in getting everyone on the same page than just growing bigger.

I often find myself in roles that connect:

-   Technology and people
-   Big ideas and the actual steps to make them happen
-   What we want to do and what is actually happening

I don't need to be the star of the show. I'm happy to be the person who helps keep everything together.

## How I Think About Work

I use the word "work," but what I really mean is where I put my attention.

I enjoy having long, quiet moments to think deeply about a problem. I love taking something complicated and making it simple enough for everyone to understand. It's a great feeling when a team stops just reacting to problems and starts moving forward with purpose.

My best days are usually the quiet ones, spent writing, organizing my thoughts, asking good questions, and listening carefully.

I'm perfectly fine working behind the scenes. Earning trust is more important to me than being in the spotlight.

## My Motivation

I've never really been motivated by job titles or status.

What really gets me excited is feeling a sense of direction. That feeling you get when you know something meaningful is being created, that people are understanding each other a little better, or that a system is becoming easier for people to use.

This has looked different at different times in my life:

-   Building organizations from the ground up
-   Writing for parents and children
-   Creating new ways for people to learn
-   Helping leadership teams think more clearly

Even though the projects change, the reason I do them stays the same.

## A Gentle Approach to Technology

I don't see technology as something to be afraid of, but I don't think it's the answer to everything either.

I see it as a tool that makes things bigger.

It can amplify what's already there: clarity or confusion, care or neglect, good intentions or just more noise.

That's why I'm so interested in how we introduce technology to people, especially to children, teams, and cultures that weren't involved in creating it.

My goal isn't to fear it or to praise it, but simply to understand it.

## A Few Things I Believe (For Now)

-   I prefer to go deep on a few topics rather than knowing a little about everything.
-   I'd rather have a real conversation than just broadcast my thoughts.
-   I'm a slow thinker, and I've learned to trust that pace.

I'm a mother, and that has changed everything for me. It has made my time feel more precious and has made honesty a top priority.

I don't think there's one right way to live or work. But I do believe in paying close attention to what's really going on around us.

## Where I Am Today

I live in Spain.

I work with people and teams from all over the world, in many different fields.

I write to help myself think. I build systems to help support people. And in everything I do, I try to leave things a little clearer and better than I found them.

## If You've Read This Far

This page isn't here to convince you of anything.

It's just a way for you to know who's behind the words on this site. If any of this connects with you, I'm glad you're here.
