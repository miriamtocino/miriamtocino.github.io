## Me in 10 seconds

I’ve spent my life moving between disciplines (architecture, software, education, and operations) learning how people make sense of complexity together.

I work at the intersection of technology and human systems, helping teams find clarity, alignment, and a steady way forward.

I live in Spain. I work quietly, alongside people building meaningful things.
