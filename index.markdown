## A Little About Me

I've spent my life exploring different fields, from architecture and software to education and operations. Through it all, my focus has always been on how people work together to make sense of complex things.

I work at the intersection of technology and human systems, where I help teams find clarity, get aligned, and move forward with a steady purpose.

I live in Spain and enjoy working quietly alongside people who are building meaningful things.

## My Books

Some ideas need a little more room to grow. I'm currently writing a collection of books called [Zerus & Ona](https://www.zerusxona.com), which explores technology, values, and what it means to grow up in a digital world.
