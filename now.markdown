# What I’m Doing Now

(This is [a now page](https://nownownow.com/about). If you have your own site, [I recommend making one](https://nownownow.com/about).)

Updated December 21st, 2025, from Spain.

## Work

I’m focused on creating clarity inside complex systems.

Most of my time is spent:
- working alongside teams as things take shape
- helping ideas become decisions
- supporting the movement from intention to action

I tend to work close to where strategy, technology, and people meet,
paying attention to how alignment forms, or quietly breaks.

I’m doing fewer things, more deliberately.

## Writing

I write to think.

Writing helps me slow things down enough to see what’s actually happening,
before opinions harden or momentum takes over.

Some of this writing is private.
Some of it becomes public.
Either way, it’s part of how I make sense of my work.

## Learning

I’m learning by staying close to real situations.

I’m noticing:
- how decisions gather weight
- how context changes outcomes
- how small structural choices compound over time

I’m less interested in novelty,
and more interested in understanding what lasts.

## Life

I live in Spain.

My days have a steady rhythm:
- focused work blocks
- time outdoors
- quiet evenings

I’m protecting time and attention more carefully than before.
Less noise. Fewer inputs. More space.

Motherhood continues to shape how I relate to time and care.
It keeps me honest about what matters.

## People

I value depth over reach.

I prefer thoughtful conversations to constant contact,
and environments where people are allowed to think out loud.

Trust, for me, grows through clarity and consistency.

## For Now

I’m focused on doing the work in front of me well.

Paying attention to what’s happening,
and staying present with the people and systems I’m part of.
