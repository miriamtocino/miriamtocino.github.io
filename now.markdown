# What I’m Up To Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), which is a great idea if you have your own site.)

*Updated December 21st, 2025, from my home in Spain.*

## At Work

My main focus right now is bringing a sense of clarity to complex systems. Most of my days are spent working closely with teams as they figure things out, helping turn good ideas into clear decisions, and making sure that what we intend to do actually gets done.

I tend to find myself at the intersection of strategy, technology, and people. I pay a lot of attention to how teams come together and where things might be quietly falling apart. My goal is to do fewer things, but to do them with more thought and purpose.

## Writing

For me, writing is a way of thinking. It helps me slow down and really see what’s going on before opinions get set in stone or things start moving too fast.

Some of what I write is just for me, and some of it I share publicly. Either way, it’s a big part of how I make sense of the world and my work in it.

## Learning

I’m learning by staying connected to real-world situations. I’m paying attention to the little things that make a big difference, like how decisions gain importance over time, how the context of a situation can completely change the outcome, and how small choices can have a big impact down the road.

I’m less interested in what’s new and shiny, and more interested in understanding the things that last.

## Life

I live in Spain, and my days have a nice, steady rhythm. I have blocks of time for focused work, I make sure to get outside, and I enjoy quiet evenings.

Lately, I’ve been more protective of my time and attention. I’m trying to create more space in my life by cutting down on noise and distractions.

Being a mother continues to change how I think about time and taking care of things. It’s a constant reminder of what’s truly important.

## People

I’ve always valued deep connections over having a wide reach. I prefer thoughtful conversations over constant back-and-forth, and I love being in environments where people feel comfortable thinking out loud.

For me, trust is built on clarity and consistency.

## For Now

My main goal is simple: to do the work in front of me as well as I can. I’m focused on paying attention to what’s happening right now and being fully present with the people and systems I’m a part of.
